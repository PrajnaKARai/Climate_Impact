#Harvest Season####
#This function estimates the yield of asparagus over the season
#the total yield that comes from the field is determined by:
#accumulated growth potential, if the chill requirement is met, and the season length
#the marketable yield is determined by the quality of the spears
#weather influences the quality directly via frost, heat and rapid temperature fluctuations
#and indirectly by prohibiting harvesting on time because of rain or heat
#the fieldworker cant get on the field
